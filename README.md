# CRM_analysis
Through this project, I built a data model based on information extracted from a CRM solution. I then asked myself the following questions related to sales performance and tried to answer them: 
1. How is each sales team performing compared to the rest
2. Are any sales agents lagging behind?
3. Can you identify any quarter-over-quarter trends?
4. Do any products have better win rates?

I intentionnaly worked on Excel and only Excel as the aim of this project was to improve my knowledge of this tool.

All the answers will be found in the "data_model" file. 

Here are my answers:
