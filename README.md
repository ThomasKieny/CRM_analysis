# CRM_analysis
Through this project, I built a data model based on information extracted from a CRM solution. I then asked myself the following questions related to sales performance and tried to answer them: 
- How is each sales team performing compared to the rest?
- Are any sales agents lagging behind?
- Can you identify any quarter-over-quarter trends?
- Do any products have better win rates?

I intentionnaly worked on Excel and only Excel as the aim of this project was to improve my knowledge of this tool.

Please don't hesitate to take a look at my work and contact me if you have any question.
